## Style Guide
This application in Python follows the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Style Guide. This includes, but isn't limited to, the following guidelines:

- 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Maximum line length is 79 characters.
- Imports on separate lines.
- Using single-quoted strings consistently, except when an apostrophe appears in the string, in which case double-quotes were used to avoid backslashes, and hence improve readability.
- Comments in complete sentences and the first word is capitalised. Also inline comments were avoided.
- Function names are in lower case and words are separated by underscores. 

I also used [autopep8](https://pypi.org/project/autopep8/) to achieve the consistent style guidelines.

## Features

This terminal application is created to provide a user-friendly way for you to search, view, and learn the various information about Pokémon species. 
It includes:

### Feature 1: Display OG 151 Pokémons
A Pokémon database was created and offers easy access for you to explore and learn about their abilities.
### Feature 2: Search Pokémons
The search function enables you to look up Pokémon by their name or ID number. 
After your search, the terminal will display the chosen Pokémon along with a list of its abilities.
### Feature 3: Surprise me! (Random Pokémon)
The Random Pokémon function selects a random Pokémon from our database and presents it for you to discover. 
It's a great way to encounter Pokémon you might not be familiar with.
### Feature 4: Add new Pokémon to our database
This feature allows user to expand our existing database by inputting Pokémon details for future reference.
### Feature 5: Searching history 
This function keeps a record of your five most recent searches for your convenience.


## Implementation Plan
I used Trello to plan and execute this project. For each feature, I created a checklist to outline and keep track of completed tasks and next steps. 
Additional details and modifications were incorporated as the project progressed.

## Help Documentation

### System/Hardware requirements
To run this application, you'll need Python 3. If you haven't installed Python 3 yet, you can follow the [beginner's guide](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download) for your specific operating system to get it up and running. Additionally, this application, when used with Python 3, requires the installation of 'pip.' You can find installation instructions for 'pip' in the [provided guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

Python 3.3 and later versions come with the virtual environment 'venv' built-in, so you won't need to install it separately if your Python version is 3.3 or newer.
