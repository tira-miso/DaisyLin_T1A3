## R5: Style Guide
This application in Python follows the [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) Style Guide. This includes, but isn't limited to, the following guidelines:

- 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Maximum line length is 79 characters.
- Imports on separate lines.
- Using single-quoted strings consistently, except when an apostrophe appears in the string, in which case double-quotes were used to avoid backslashes, and hence improve readability.
- Comments in complete sentences and the first word is capitalised. Also inline comments were avoided.
- Function names are in lower case and words are separated by underscores to improve readability.
